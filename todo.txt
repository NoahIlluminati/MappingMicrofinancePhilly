KNOWN ISSUES
    -The infowindows can take a long time to load (10sec +) when a user has input a zip code and they click on
    a point with many overlapping markers
        -possibles fix: buidling SQL indexes in the CartoDB database
        -restructuring the SQL used to select overlapping points (especially how it uses the pre-existing sql for the sublayer)

    -There is very little form validation on the server side in updateForm.php. This could cause problems if javascript was disabled
    while updating.

    -The process for putting files on the Drupal site is pretty awkward, ideally the files would just be in a drupal folder
    instead of copy pasted using the administrator UI
        -Also, ideally the files would more split up, but the necessity of needing to copy them all at once onto drupal means
        that html, css, and javascript are all included together

    -Automated testing would be nice

    -get images for close icon for infowindows from a better place, currently they are somewhere on the library server
