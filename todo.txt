Main Tasks To Think About:
    -reset zoom level button (css is weird in mobile) (seems corrected)
    -update form validation / where to put API key
    -backup data (done on test account)
    -automatic deletion with cron (seems to work? Possibly inconsistent)
    -building sql indexes
    -fix css, z-index problems, with the main menu
