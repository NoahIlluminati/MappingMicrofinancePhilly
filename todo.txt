-Get drupal to automatically delete nodes: NOTE: seems to work when importing manually, not with cron

-think about feedback

-"we don't have that zipcode in our database message" (done: edge case where user refreshes with unknown zip, won't show anything)


-reorder filter by type list (not that reordered)
-instead of deselect all and show all, one start over button
-above fixed but now zip code not working on load (fixed)

-testing on many browsers / operating systems
  -menus not working on phone screen!!!! (fixed)


-drupal webform to update cartodb (sort of, see meeting notes)
-things think about for the form:
    -where to put API key
    -how to organize update page
