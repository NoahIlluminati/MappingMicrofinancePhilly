The process so far for getting these files on Drupal when updates are necessary:
    -copy paste the DrupalMap.html file into the Greater Philadelphia Map basic page using the edit function.
    -copy paste drupalsidebar.html into the Filters block, this gets placed in the sidebar of the map.
    -copy paste updateForm.php into the Philly Update Form page
        NOTE: the api keys are missing from these files, they need to be pasted in (only for the update form)
