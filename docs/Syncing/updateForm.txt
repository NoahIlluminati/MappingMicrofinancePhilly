Documentation for updateForm.Php

updateForm.php contains CSS, PHP, HTML, and javascript to create a simple update form that can be used
to update the CartoDB database through the Drupal site.

--Styling--:
    Nothing too complicated here. The divs for updating and deleting are hidden by default. Although the updating
    process mostly just uses the same HTML as adding a location.

--PHP--:
    No libraries used except for the Curl extension, which doesn't really seem to be an outside library...?

    The goal of the PHP is to recieve the data from the HTML when the form is submitted.
    Then the PHP calls the CartoDB SQL API to insert, update, or delete location data.
    If it fails, the PHP should inform the user and give meaningful errors (this is the part that needs the most work probably)

    A. Submission Process
        1. When the user presses submit, the page is reloaded.
        2. The submitted data is put into a different array where ' is replaced with '', the escaping practice for Postgres
        3. No matter what, calls are made to both CartoDB and Dropbox through the BackupToDropBox() function to create timestamped backups
        of location and the lookup tables
        4. The PHP checks what mode the form was in: add, update, or delete. Then it reacts correspondingly
            a.
