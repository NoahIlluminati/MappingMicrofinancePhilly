Documentation for drupalsidebar.html

This file includes only html. This html is meant to be used in Filters block on drupal.

--HTML--:
    The first part of this is the form where the user can input their zipcode.
    Nothing to strange here.

    Next are the filters used for types. All types have been placed into categories. It is important that the
    category title is in <h3> tags and that the types in that category are in a div below that <h3>, but are not
    children of the <h3>. The togglepanels() function specifically looks for this, so it will not work if the structure
    is disrupted.
    Each type has an input and label.
    Each input has a data attribute and a data-urlid attribute.
    data:
        This stores the SQL that each input is responsible for. Clicking on an input adds its data as a condition to the
        WHERE clause of the SQL.
    data-urlid:
        This is the letter used to represent this field in the hash. These could be changed to something more intuitive.
