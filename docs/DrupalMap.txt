Documentation for DrupalMap.html

This file includes html, css, and javascript for the map that can be copied and pasted into a drupal page.
This does NOT include the html for the filters, but it does include their styling and the javascript that
gives them functionality.

The map relies extensively on both Cartodb.js and the Cartodb SQL API, so check those out first.

--Styling--:
    The first two style tags contain the cartocss that styles the map. This first applies to the points on
    the map, while the second applies to the county lines.

    The next style tag contains some styles pulled from a Cartodb tutorial stylesheet at http://academy.cartodb.com/css/cdbui.css.

    The last style tag contains most of the styles for the map. Unfortunately, there was no clear mobile first or desktop
    first approach when this project started, so both the desktop and mobile media queries overwrite styles. Other than that,
    there are a lot of id's, but it should be clear which id's are which.

--HTML--:
    Nothing complicated here except for the templates used to create the infowindows. These are rendered using underscore.js(_.js)
    and contain javascript and variables that are passed in by the javascript at the bottom of the page. The important thing here
    is that the infowindows are dynamic and change depending on which point is clicked. The body of the infowindow, which corresponds
    to a single organization, is contained in a separate template from the main infowindow template.

--Javascript--:
    Libraries Used:
        jQuery, Cartodb.js (Cartodb.js contains underscore.js so that is used as well)

    Functions:
    NOTE: If a function was taken from another source(Stack Overflow, etc.) then there should be a url comment next to it for further reference.

        togglepanels: This creates a menu with expanding dropdown headers. It is a plugin for jQuery, and follows the same rules as jQuery UI's accordion
        function. The difference being that it doesn't apply classes and doesn't collapse all the other headers when one is expanded.

        popMenu: Toggles the filters on mobile.

        addCursorInteraction: Makes the cursor switch to a pointer if the user hovers over a point on the map

        updateHash: Called whenever the user changes the inputs in the filters. It iterates through the inputs and changes the hash to reflect that, using
            letters to correspond to a different input. If the value is set to 1 then it represents that the input is checked.
