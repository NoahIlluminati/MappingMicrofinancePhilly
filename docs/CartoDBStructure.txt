There are 5 important tables in the CartoDB database

location: all information on small business resources besides types and areas served
area_served: all names of areas served and the polygons they cover
type: all the possible types of an organization
lookup_loc_area: lookup table used to relate location to area_served
lookup_loc_type: lookup table used to relate location to type

The lookup tables are made up of entries with an id for the location and an id for the property they
are relating location to. This way, a single location can be matched multiple types or area_served.
NOTE: CartoDB actually supports arrays, so it might be a good idea to use those instead of bothering with lookup tables.

COLUMNS

location:
    cartodb_id: serial primary key
    the_geom: coordinates
    address: street address
    city
    email
    link: link to website
    loc_name: name of the location/Organization
    mission: mission statement
    phone_number
    state
    zipcode

area_served:
    cartodb_id: serial primary key
    the_geom: polygons to show what area the areas take up
    area_name

type:
    cartodb_id: serial primary key
    type: the name of a type

lookup_loc_area:
    cartodb_id: serial primary key
    loc_id: identifies the location that has a specific area served, corresponds to a cartodb_id in the location table
    area_id: identifies the area served that belongs to a specific location, corresponds to a specific area in the area_served table

lookup_loc_type:
    cartodb_id: serial primary key
    loc_id: identifies the location that has a specific type, corresponds to a cartodb_id in the location table
    type_id: identifies the type that belongs to a specific location, corresponds to a specific area in the type table
